Explanation of the Output Order

The King has entered the court:
This is a synchronous console.log and is executed immediately.

The court session has ended.:
Another synchronous console.log, executed right after the first one.

Your Majesty, thereâ€™s an urgent matter.:
The process.nextTick callback is executed right after the current synchronous code, as process.nextTick is part of the microtask queue.

The Jester performs a quick act!:
The setTimeout callback is executed after the microtasks, as it is in the macrotask queue.

The Bard sings:
The asynchronous file read completes, and its callback is added to the macrotask queue, executed after the setTimeout.
